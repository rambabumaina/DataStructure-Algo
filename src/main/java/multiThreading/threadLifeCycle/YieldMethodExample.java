//Definition :yield() method when called on thread gives a hint to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of a processor.
// The thread scheduler is free to ignore this hint.

//Exception : yield() method doesnâ€™t throws any exception.

//Waiting time : yield() method stops thread for unpredictable time.

//Native method : Implementation of yield() method is provided by JVM.

//yield() is a static method, hence calling Thread.yield() causes currently executing thread to yield.
